# EtherTDD.js 
EtherTDD is a collection of testing tools for Ethereum contracts.

EtherTDD.js is best-suited for testing contracts on a blockchain from within a dapp browser such as Mist or AlethZero. This can be advantageous if your contract integrates with contracts controlled by third parties. However, this does mean that the testing process is heavier and slower than it would be with [EtherTDD.py](https://github.com/ethermarket/ethertdd.py). Ideally you'd write your integration tests with EtherTDD.js and write your unit tests with EtherTDD.py.
